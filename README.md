# UI-UX-Case-Study
Initiated a project that helped passengers to book a taxi online that generated 5K+ user interest.
The user-centric interface was design in 2 months based on Information Architecture using a tool Figma through wireframing, prototyping and user testing.
Received great feedback after user testing.
